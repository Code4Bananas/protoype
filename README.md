# Geosockets

Geosockets is a node webserver and javascript browser client for rendering website
visitors on a map in realtime using WebSockets and the browser's Geolocation API.

See the demo app at [geosockets.herokuapp.com](https://geosockets.herokuapp.com).

### Using the Client Script on Your Site

The Geosockets javascript client can be used on any website:

```html
<script src="https://geosockets.herokuapp.com/client.js"></script>
<script>
  window.geosocket = new Geosocket({
    host: "wss://geosockets.herokuapp.com" // (default)
  });
</script>
<div id="geosockets"></div>
```

Use CSS to configure the size and position of the map container:

```css
#geosockets {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

### The Server

[server.coffee](https://github.com/heroku-examples/geosockets/blob/master/server.coffee) is a node app powered by [express 3](http://expressjs.com/guide.html), node's native [http](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) module, and the [einaros/ws](https://github.com/einaros/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md) WebSocket implementation. Express is used to serve the static frontend in `/public`.

When building web apps designed to scale, you should never assume that anything cached in memory or on disk will be available on a future request or job. Geosockets uses Redis to persist visitor data, treating Dynos as [stateless processes](http://12factor.net/processes): changes in the app's [Dyno formation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scaling#dyno-formation) should be impercetible to users.

### The Client

[client.coffee](https://github.com/heroku-examples/geosockets/blob/master/client.coffee) is also written as a node app. [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#readme) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) are used to compile the client into a single browser-ready javascript file.

When the client is first run in the browser, a [UUID](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid#readme) token is generated and stored in a cookie which is passed to the server in the headers of each WebSocket message. This gives the server a consistent way to identify each user.

The client uses the [browser's geolocation API](https://www.google.com/search?q=browser%20geolocation%20api) and the [geolocation-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/geolocation-stream#readme) node module to determine the user's physical location, continually listening for location updates in realtime.

Once the WebSocket connection is establised, the client broadcasts its location to the server. The client then listens
for messages from the server, rendering and removing markers from the map as site visitors come and go.

### Running Geosockets Locally

If you're new to Heroku or Node.js development, you'll need to install a few things first:

1. [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com), which gives you git, foreman, and the heroku command-line interface.
1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
1. [redis](http://redis.io/). If you're using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), install with `brew install redis`

Clone the repo and install npm dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/heroku-examples/geosockets.git
cd geosockets
npm install
```

Fire up redis, a grunt watcher, and the node webserver at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000):

````
foreman start
```

### Deploying Geosockets to Heroku

```
heroku create my-geosockets-app
heroku labs:enable websockets
heroku addons:add openredis:micro # $10/month
git push heroku master
heroku open
```
