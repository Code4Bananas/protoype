# geosockets

geosockets is a node webserver and javascript browser client for rendering
any site's visitors on a map in realtime using WebSockets.

See the demo app at [geosockets.heroku.com](https://geosockets.heroku.com).

### server.coffee

The server is a node app powered by [express 3](http://expressjs.com/guide.html), node's native [http](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) module, and the [einaros/ws](https://github.com/einaros/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md) WebSocket implementation. Express is used to serve the static frontend in `/public`.

> The twelve-factor app never assumes that anything cached in memory or on disk will be available on a future request or job.

Redis is used to persist visitor data. This allows the dynos running your app to act as [stateless processes](http://12factor.net/processes). In the context of Heroku, this means designing your app to withstand changes like restarting processes or scaling dynos up or down.

### client.coffee

[Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#readme) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) are used to compile
server.coffee into a single browser-ready javascript file.

When the client is first run in the browser, a [UUID](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid#readme) token is generated
and stored in a cookie which is passed to the server within the headers of each WebSocket message. This gives the server a consistent way to identify each user.

The client uses the [browser's geolocation API](https://www.google.com/search?q=browser%20geolocation%20api) and the
[geolocation-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/geolocation-stream#readme) node module to determine the user's physical location, continually listening for location updates in realtime.

Once the WebSocket connection is establised, the client broadcasts its location to the server.

The client listens for messages from the server, rendering a marker on the map for each new visitor,
and removing markers as visitors leave the site.

### Running the App Locally

If you're new to Heroku or Node.js development, you'll need to install a few things first:

1. [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com), which gives you git, foreman, and the heroku command-line interface.
1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
1. [redis](http://redis.io/). If you're using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), install with `brew install redis`

Clone the repo and install npm dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/heroku-examples/geosockets.git
cd geosockets
npm install
```

Fire up redis, a grunt watcher, and the node webserver at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000):

````
foreman start
```

### Using the Client Script on Your Site

The Geosockets client can be used on any website. Just drop in the hotlinked script tag
and create a DOM element with an id of `geosockets` to contain the map.

```html
<script src="https://raw.github.com/heroku-examples/geosockets/master/public/client.js"></script>
<div id="geosockets"></div>
```

Use CSS to configure the size and position of the map:

```css
#geosockets {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

### Testing

Geosockets is tested with [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest#readme). Supertest pairs nicely with Express, allowing the entire express app to be mounted for simple and clean webservice integration tests.

```
npm test
```
